      <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f3e8ff, #fef3c7); padding: 30px; border-radius: 12px; border-left: 6px solid #a78bfa; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <h3 style="color: #6b4fcf; margin-top: 0;">To Chino, Beanie & Little</h3>
        <p style="color: #4a3a7a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
          On that tragic day, our world changed forever. You three — inseparable souls, bound by love and joy — 
          crossed the Rainbow Bridge together. Though the pain of losing you all at once is immeasurable, 
          I find comfort knowing you are together, where suffering cannot reach.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #4a3a7a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
          You taught me that love knows no bounds. In every tail wag, every greeting at the door, every 
          quiet moment by my side — you showed me pure, unconditional devotion. Your absence is felt in 
          every room, on every walk, in the silence where your laughter used to be.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #6b4fcf; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">
          Until we meet again at the Rainbow Bridge — you are loved beyond measure. Forever and always.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #be123c; margin-top: 0;">To Rosie, Lil Bit & Sinner</h3>
        <p style="color: #4a3a7a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
          My extended family, but no less loved. You came into our lives at different times, leaving your 
          own unique paw prints on my heart. Whether you spent years with us or brief, cherished moments, 
          you mattered. You were family.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #4a3a7a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
          Each of you had your own spirit, your own way of showing love. And though our time together 
          may have been different, the bond we shared was real, genuine, and eternal.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #be123c; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">
          You will always be remembered. You will always be loved.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #6b4fcf;">Why I Created Over the Rainbow</h3>
        <p style="color: #5a4a8a; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
          Losing Chino, Beanie, and Little changed everything. The grief was suffocating — sudden, 
          overwhelming, and all-consuming. I searched everywhere for a place to honor them, to speak their 
          names, to keep their memories alive. I couldn't find what I needed.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #5a4a8a; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
          So I created this space. <strong>Over the Rainbow</strong> exists because pet loss is real grief, 
          and every beloved companion — regardless of how long they were with us — deserves to be remembered, 
          honored, and celebrated.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #5a4a8a; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
          If you're grieving a pet, know that your pain is valid. Your love was real. And your companion — 
          whether they spent a lifetime with you or just a moment — deserves to be memorialized. 
          This is my gift to you. And to my beloved boys and girls who inspired it.
